#__init__ is like another other method it can be inherited
#if a class does not have __init__ constructor python will check its parent class to see if it can find one
#as soon as it finds one python calls it and stops looking
#we can use super() function to call methods in the parent class
#we may want to initalize in the parent as well as our own classs
