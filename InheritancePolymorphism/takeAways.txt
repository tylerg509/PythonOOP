#__init__ is like another other method it can be inherited
#if a class does not have __init__ constructor python will check its parent class to see if it can find one
#as soon as it finds one python calls it and stops looking
#we can use super() function to call methods in the parent class
#we may want to initalize in the parent as well as our own classs

#class methods = if only useing class attribute
#static method if writing a utility method that does not need the instance

#abstract classs is a kind of model for other classes to be defined
# it is not designed to construct instance but can be subclassed by regular classes
# use the abc module to enable creation of abstract base classes

#inheritance can be brittle
#doucoupled code is classess functions that work independetly and dont depend on eachother
#as long as the interface is maintained interactions between classes will work
#not checking or requiring particular types is polymorphic and pythonic
