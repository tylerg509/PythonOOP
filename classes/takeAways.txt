1) an instance of a class knows what class its from
2) variables defined in the class are available to the instance
3) a method on an instance passes instance as the first argument to the method. within the method the first argument should be self
4) instnaces have there own data = instance attributes (state)
5) variables defined i nthe class are class attributes
6) when we read an attribute pyhon looks for it first in the instance and then in the class

class = blueprint for an instance
instance = constructed object of the class
type = the class the instance belongs to 
attribute = any object value = object.attribute
method = a callable attribute defined in a class
